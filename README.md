The project is divided into two deliverables:

1- WeatherPy 
 In this project citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API and problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities. 
 The output for this analysis are:
 1) Open weather API is used to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated by citipy . A series of scatter plots are generated for cities against weather parameters (Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed).
 2) Linear regression is computed for each analysis and the plot is seperated by cities in northern and southern hemisphere.

2- VacationPy
 In this weather data is used to plan future vacation. Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API are used.
 The output from this analysis are:
 1) Map visualisation using  the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library.
 2) Ideal place for vacation is decided using weather conditions for temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed. The Geoapify API is used to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of coordinates in each ideal city.
    The hotel name and the country are displayed as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map.
